  This project is designed to create insight into the the severity of COVID, especially in the United States. Aside from simple analysis with regards to healthcare and statewide data, Machine learning is applied to serve as a method of patient analysis upon presentation. Utilizing open and peer reviewed sources, scalable data simulations are used to serve as a method for KNN modeling, as well as Probit Regression analyis. 
  
  The goal for this project is to create an understanding of risk per patient, based on presenting symptoms. Utilization of KNN modeling and Probit Regression allows for accurate assessment of high-risk symptoms that may lead to mortality.
